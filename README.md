# Housing_in_France_2020
Python project about sales related to buildings in France during 2020

In this project, we tried to understand what were the tendencies regarding real estate in France for the year 2020. 
We also compare it with the 2019 results.

# Preprocessing

The first part transforms the raw data into a valuable dataset easy to plot. We notably get rid of nan values, inconsistencies or redundancy using simple Python functions.

# Analysis of the 2020 data

We mainly use pyplot, pandas, seaborn, squarify, circlify to extract information out of our dataset.

One of our main achievements was to create interactive maps of France or the city of Paris to allow us to make our data understandable for everyone.
We use the folium library.

# Comparison between the 2020 and 2019 sales

To measure the impact of the sanitary crisis, we decided to compare the results between multiple years.

It was also a good way to see in which cities the french show interest with this animation.

# Conclusion

To conclude, we learn a lot from this project whether it is about Python or the real estate market and how it was affected by the COVID-19.
